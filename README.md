# UoB CO2 Monitor

## What's this project?

This project is intended to be an open-source CO2 air-exchange monitoring and alerting system, used with the Smart Citizen IoT platform. It will provide an android application which users can download to interactively check effective CO2 levels and airflow data in supported buildings near their location. Users will be able to add and remove devices, to view at-a-glance or detailed analysis of CO2 readings, and to receive push notifications when anomalous levels are detected.

## What components does it have?

As well as an android application (written in Dart/Flutter), we will provide a server component (in Java/Spring Boot) to control it and provide data; and additionally a "control panel" website that allows configuring parts of the server from a non-technical point of view is planned.
