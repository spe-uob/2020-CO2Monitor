# UoB CO2 Monitor

## What's this project?

This project is intended to be an open-source CO2 air-exchange monitoring and alerting system, used with the Smart Citizen IoT platform. It's probably going to involve a server written in Java, but many of the technical details are still up in the air, given the project is still in its earliest stages.
