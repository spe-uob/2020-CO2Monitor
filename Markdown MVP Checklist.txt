## Checks
- [ ] 3 named User Stories implemented
- [ ] Test cases successfully passed
- [ ] System deployed, accessible to the client
- [ ] Client successfully interacted with system

## Notes
Our project requires the creation of a mobile application which actually has very
little interaction in itself. The purpose of the application is to keep the user
informed about the levels of CO2, as such, user interaction does not form a significant part
of our core functionality for the MVP.
